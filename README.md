## Site Description 	
 	
The Florida Everglades Shark River Slough Mangrove Forest site is located along the Shark River in the western region of Everglades National Park. Also referred to as site SRS6 of the Florida Coastal Everglades LTER program, freshwater in the mangrove riverine floods the forest floor under a meter of water twice per day. Transgressive discharge of freshwater from the Shark river follows annual rainfall distributions between the wet and dry seasons. Hurricane Wilma struck the site in October of 2005 causing significant damage. The tower was offline until the following October in order to continue temporally consistent measurements. In post-hurricane conditions, ecosystem respiration rates and solar irradiance transfer increased. 2007- 2008 measurements indicate that these factors led to an decline in both annual -NEE and daily NEE from pre-hurricane conditions in 2004-2005.

Research Topics: 	
 	
The research and science objectives of the Florida Everglades Shark River Slough Mangrove Forest site are as follows: 1) Determine if seasonal variations in freshwater flow and local diurnal tides were important in regulating organic carbon exchange in this wetland; 2) Investigate how the functioning of mangroves in the Florida Everglades respond to environmental forcing on carbon assimilation over diurnal and seasonal time scales; 3) Determine net ecosystem production (NEP) and key environmental controls on net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of carbon dioxide (CO2) between a mangrove forest and the atmosphere in the coastal Florida Everglades; 4) Quantify the degree to which carbon balance in these coastal systems will change in response to variable salinity and freshwater inundation patterns; 5) Investigate the the response of a mangrove ecosystem to the expected increases in water flows from climate change.
